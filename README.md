# runner_winner

This is a running motivational CLI application that allows users to start a challenge with a friend for a period of time (1 week, 1 month etc), and then decides the winner based on who ran more over the duration of the challenge. The idea is to reward the winner either with points or with money, that acts as a motivating factor for people to run.
The application can also helps the users in finding running tracks or scenic spots by suggesting running parks/jogging tracks near your usual starting location. 

I used strava's API to get running data for the user and the competitor and I implemented the track suggestions using the google places API
